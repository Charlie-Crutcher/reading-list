# reading-list

A simple program that shows my current and future reading list.

This will eventually get more complex as I learn more about the coding language, however even in it's simplist form it serves a purpose.

I have factored reading and audio books into my daily routine and am currently reading 30 minutes MINIMUM a day, but I usually surpass this fairly easy goal.

Any book recommendations are graciously appreciated!
